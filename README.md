## 💾 Overview
**Undertale-RuneFusion** is a Unity-based engine that recreates the core mechanics of **Undertale** and **Deltarune** — including:
- Classic top-down **Frisk movement** with sprite animations.
- Scene-based **room transitions** with spawn markers (`Mark A`, `Mark B`).
- In-game **menu system** with SOUL navigation, item usage, and stats.
- Authentic **UI layout**, **SFX**, and **game flow** inspired by Toby Fox’s originals.
- 100% editable in the Unity Editor, making it easy for fans and developers to build custom content.
